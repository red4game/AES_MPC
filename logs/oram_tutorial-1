Significant amount of unused inverses of SPDZ gfp. For more accurate benchmarks, consider reducing the batch size with -b.
The following timing is inclusive preprocessing.
Time = 118.639 seconds 
Time1 = 0.000437035 seconds (0 MB)
Data sent = 12317.1 MB in ~294433 rounds (party 1; rounds counted double due to multi-threading)
Global data sent = 24634.3 MB (all parties)
This program might benefit from some protocol options.
Consider adding the following at the beginning of 'oram_tutorial.mpc':
	program.use_edabit(True)
